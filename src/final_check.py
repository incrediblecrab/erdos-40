"""The gate for Erdős #40: check the committed results, the Lean records, and every number, quotation, excerpt and generated table in the documentation.

Each check is a function of a context that holds the documentation, the committed files and, once refs/fetch.sh has run, the downloaded sources. It returns the problems it found, or raises Skip when an input it needs is absent. Before reporting, the script applies each planted defect to a copy of the context and requires the check it targets to fail; every check has at least one.

The greedy list is rechecked here in a third implementation, sharing no code with src/greedy_b2g.c or src/greedy_check.py: a B2[2] test by sorting all pairwise sums a <= b as uint32, the greedy rule for the first RULE_TERMS terms against a table of counts, and the checkpoints recomputed in exact decimal arithmetic. The Theorem B constants are recomputed with mpmath at the recorded minimising n and at sample points, and the table of k in exact rationals.

In the prose of the documentation every numeral must be accounted for: decimals and integers of three or more digits everywhere, formulas included, and smaller integers outside formulas. A numeral is accounted for when it is compared with a fresh value (ANCHORS); lies inside a text that a source backs (FACTS, QUOTES) or a worded claim that the records back (CLAIMS, whose number word is compared with a count); names a problem that refs/fetch.sh downloads, a section of NOTES.md, or a lemma or step that NOTES.md defines; is an exit status, 0 or 1; is the major version of Lean in lean/lean-toolchain or of the Python running this script; is an identifier that refs/fetch.sh fetches; is an ordered-list marker; or lies in one of the PROVENANCE labels, which are printed as unchecked. Small integers inside formulas are mathematics, which the proofs check and this scan does not. Code, links and generated tables are exempt from the scan; the generated tables must equal a fresh rendering instead.

Usage: python src/final_check.py [--write] [--strict] [--plant NAME] [--list]
  --write       regenerate the generated tables in the documentation, then exit
  --strict      count a skipped check as a failure; use it once refs/ is populated
  --plant NAME  apply one planted defect and run every check: exit 1 if some check fails, as it should, 0 if none does
  --list        list the checks and the plants
Exit 0 means no check failed and every plant whose check ran was caught; with --strict, also that no check and no plant was skipped. A run that passes with skips ends "PASS, incomplete".
